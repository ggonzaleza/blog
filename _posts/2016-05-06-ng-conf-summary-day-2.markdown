TODO: Brief Summary of all the events that happened Day 1.

Day 2 of ng-conf is mostly comprised of workshops and hands-on learning. As the workshops are spread across the Grand American hotel, we won't be able to cover all of them, so in today's post we'll focus on the big things we picked up along the way.
